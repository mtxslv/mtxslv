### Hi there 👋! _mtxslv_ here 🤙🏼

Below you can find some summarized information about me 😉:

- 🔭 **What do you do?**
  - _I'm a data scientist currently working with data 🗄️ from the Oil & Gas 🛢️ industry. My main focus is training AI models using MLOps methodology._
- 🌱 **What you've been doing lately?**
  - _I'm currently learning TinyML and Edge AI. This means I am learning how to put an AI model inside a thing like Arduino or similar (we usually name these 'constrained devices'). All the materials I'll be making will be published [here](https://github.com/mtxslv/embedded.ai.mtxslv)._ 
  - _Besides that, I'll be graduating in Mechatronics Engineering soon (I'm a mechatronics technician already)._
- ⚡ **Tell me more about you as a person, not as a student or something...**  
  - _I love art 🎨 in general. Generative Art with AI amazes me. I'm used to play with some of these technologies (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc) and post the results on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/watashiwa_axis/). If you are curious, but not certain of what it means, [here is one of my experiments](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChmzOUdr7Xn/) to get you interested (hopefully)._
